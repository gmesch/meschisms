        <h1>Why write bash scripts</h1>

        <div class="text" step="1">Engineering is the art of never doing anything more than twice. You
          do somthing manually once. Eventually you may do it again. But before
          you do it a third time, you build an engine that does it for you. This
          is what makes you an engineer -- building engines, not operating
          them. This distinction is clearer in German, which uses the French
          word Ingenieur, which derives from ingenuity. You need more ingenuity
          to build engines than to operate them.</div>

        <div class="text" step="2">Configuring computers is notorious for doing things
          manually. Witness the usual README.md file describing how to install
          some opensource software and its prerequisites. Or the average Google
          Cloud documentation page. All this is subject to engineering too. Once
          you did it, you should have a program doing it for you. Anything that
          you did in a shell in a terminal, you can easily convert into a shell
          script. Once converted, shell scripts can raise productivity not just
          by doing the same thing automatically,but also by automating
          variations: repeating things in a loop, or following decisions to
          alternative variants. Thus shell scripts are a natural and
          effective ways to build engines from simple interactions.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide build-focus-visible continued" group="intro">
        <h1>Why write bash scripts</h1>

        <div class="text" step="1">Shell scripts, however, have a reputation for
          not being robust, especially not at scale. Very simple habits increase
          robustness tremendously. The following pages summarize and motivate
          these habits for the bash shell.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide build-focus-visible" group="rules" name="set-e">
        <h1>Fail at every error</h1>

        <div class="snippet">
          <pre class="prettyprint">set -e</pre>
        </div>

        <div class="text">The option `-e` causes the shell to exit with error
          status altogether whenever any command it executes fails.
        </div>

        <div class="text">Failure status of a command is also used to make
          decisions in branch statements like `if`. If a command in the decision
          clause of an `if` statement fails, it causes the flow of control to
          take the `else` branch as usual, not to exit the whole program.</div>

        <div class="text">If any step in a program fails, the program as a whole
          should fail. Otherwise it is unclear what the rest of the program
          would do. Sometimes failure is acceptable, in that case the exit can
          be explictly prevented, for example by excuting it inside an `if`
          statement to check for its error status.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide build-focus-visible" group="rules" name="pipefail">
        <h1>Fail at really every error</h1>

        <div class="snippet">
          <pre class="prettyprint">set -o pipefail</pre>
        </div>

        <div class="text">The shell makes it easy to plug commands together in
          pipelines. Normally a pipeline command is considered failed (and
          causes the shell to exit when `set -e` is on) if the last command in
          the pipeline fails. This option makes a pipeline fail if any command
          in the pipeline fails.
        </div>

        <div class="text">Same as for `set -e`.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide build-focus-visible" group="rules" name="declare-r">
        <h1>Define all variables const</h1>

        <div class="snippet">
          <pre class="prettyprint">declare -r FOO=bar</pre>
        </div>

        <div class="text">The option `-r` to the `declare` builtin makes a variable value
          immutable.
        </div>

        <div class="text">Motivation: This makes it very reliable to lookup the meaning of a
          variable: If you find the `declare` statement of the variable, you
          know this is the value it must have wherever it is referenced, because
          there is no way to ever change its value in between the definition and
          the use.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide build-focus-visible" group="rules" name="set-u">
        <h1>Fail at undefined variables</h1>

        <div class="snippet">
          <pre class="prettyprint">set -u</pre>
        </div>

        <div class="text">The option `-u` makes it an error to reference undefined
          variables. Together with option `-e`, it causes the shell to exit with
          error whenever an undefined variable is used.
        </div>

        <div class="text">Motivation: Variables are easier to understand if they are
          defined. So every variable should be defined before it's used. This
          enforces it.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide build-focus-visible" group="rules" name="set-u">
        <h1>Summary of semantic safety rules</h1>

        <div class="snippet">
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            set -euo pipefail
            declare -r FOO=bar

            echo "FOO=${FOO}"
          </pre>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
          These 3 rules make shell scripts much more robust. There are, however,
          some pitfalls in applying these rules, explained next.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide build-focus-visible" group="rules" name="subst-e">
        <h1>errors in command substitutions</h1>

        <div class="text">
          Command substutions are affected by `set -e` only in variable
          assignments but NOT in command line arguments. For example,
        </div>
        <div class="snippet">
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            PYTHON_VERSION=$(python --version | sed 's/Python //')
          </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          will fail if `python` is not found on `PATH`. But this will not:
        </div>
        <div class="snippet">
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            declare -r PYTHON_VERSION=$(python --version | sed 's/Python //')
          </pre>
        </div>

        <div class="text">The "reason" is that set -e affects command
          interpolation only if it appears in a variable assignment. It does NOT
          affect any command line interpolation in the arguments of a
          command. Now, `declare` is just another command, and the variable
          assignment is just one of its arguments. No errors are caught there.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide build-focus-visible continued" group="rules">
        <h1>errors in command substitutions</h1>

        <div class="text">
          The solution is this pattern:
        </div>
        <div class="snippet">
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            PYTHON_VERSION=$(python --version | sed 's/Python //')
            declare -r PYTHON_VERSION
            if [[ $PYTHON_VERSION = 3.* ]]; then ...; fi
          </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <ol>
            <li>Assign command interpolation to a veriable. Under `set -e` this
              fails if the command fails.
            <li>`declare -r` the variable to ensure it is not declared again.
            <li>Use the variable.
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide build-focus-visible" group="rules">
        <h1>That's really it</h1>

        <div class="text">
          With these pitfalls in mind, shell scripts are already much more
          robust.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
          Next we summarize a few concepts that are essential to understand in
          order to robust write (and read) shell scripts.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide build-focus-visible" group="rules">
        <h1>Array variables</h1>

        <div class="snippet">
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            declare -ra PIP_PACKAGES=(
              numpy
              pandas
              torch
            )
          </pre>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
          Variables can hold array values if declared using `declare -a`. It can
          be combined with `declare -r`. Like scalar variables the array value
          of a readonly array variable is immutable.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide build-focus-visible" group="rules">
        <h1>Use array variables for long argument lists</h1>

        <div class="snippet">
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            pip install "${PIP_PACKAGES[@]}"
          </pre>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
          Instead of writing long argument lists of commands in a continued
          line, write the arguments down as an array. The array elements can be
          commented on without interfering with escape character needed to
          continue a long line.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
          Array variables can be dereferenced as a list value using the `[@]`
          index inside double quotes. Using the `[*]` index dereferences all
          list values as a single string value. The command above would fail
          because it cannot install the package called `numpy pandas torch`.
